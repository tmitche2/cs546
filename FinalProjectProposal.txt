Final Project Proposal
The ultimate guide to good drinks
As a college student, most of us have attempted to make a delicious drink and have ended up with a pretty foul concoction. This is a guide to making tastier drinks so you can enjoy a refreshing drink at home instead of spending lots of money at the bars.

Core features:
- List the types of alcohol & other liquids you have and it will come up with drink recipes
- Search bar for liquids, items separated by commas
  - The home page will have the title an an explanation of what the search is supposed to do
  - If no recipes are found, or the liquid is nonexistent, return an error statement and give a return link to the home page
- Returns all the types of drinks you can make with those
- Have a checklist that users can click the alcohols that they have and submit instead of typing in the liquids
- Allow users to submit recipes
- Create tags so people can decide how strong of a drink they want:
  - A shot/strong drink: 20-40% alcohol content 
  - A mixed drink: 5-20% alcohol content
  - Casual: <5% alcohol content (alcoholic chocolates, ice cream, etc)


Extra features:
- Creating tags so people can sort drinks by different types of alcohol
